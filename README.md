# Picard-Method
 Here, Code of  Picard Iterative Method of Computer Oriented Numerical Methods in Java Language. The Picard’s iterative method gives a sequence of approximations Y1(x), Y2(x), …Yk(x) to the solution of differential equations such that the nth approximation is obtained from one or more previous approximations.
