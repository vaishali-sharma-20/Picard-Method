# Picard-Method
 Here, Code of  Picard Iterative Method of Computer Oriented Numerical Methods in Java Language. The Picard’s iterative method gives a sequence of approximations Y1(x), Y2(x), …Yk(x) to the solution of differential equations such that the nth approximation is obtained from one or more previous approximations.
# Project title

Picard Iterative Method


## Motivation

A University Assignment. Clearly Used to Solve anhy Porblem and Perform Computer Oriented Prolblems .


## Method and results

Step 1: An approximate value of y (taken, at first, to be a constant) is substituted into the right hand side of the differential equation: dy/dx= f(x, y).

Step 2: The equation is then integrated with respect to x giving y in terms of x as a second approximation, into which given numerical values are substituted and the result rounded off to an assigned number of decimal places or significant figures.

Step 3: The iterative process is continued until two consecutive numerical solutions are the same when rounded off to the required number of decimal places.
